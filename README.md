# Machine Learning non-supervis√©

## Project Description

### Using KMeans for Uber Trips

The objective of this project is to become familiar with the **KMeans** model in today's world.</br>
Imagine that you are **Uber** and want to give recommendations as to where the drivers should be to maximize their chances of finding a ride.

I used an unsupervised machine learning model to create this recommendation algorithm. **(Kmeans & DBSCAN)**</br>

Here is my work plan:
1. Data mining
2. Find the optimum number of clusters
3. Display these clusters on a map
4. Taking into account the periods of the day
5. Observation of the differences between KMeans and DBSCAN
